# ATS Compliance Requirements for Exported Documents

## Overview

This document outlines the compliance requirements for the exported documents to ensure they are ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly. The goal is to create exports that are easily parsed by ATS software, improving the chances of candidates being recognized and considered for job opportunities.

## Key Compliance Features

1. **Simple Formatting**
   - Use a single-column layout to avoid confusion during parsing.
   - Avoid complex formatting such as tables, columns, or graphics that may disrupt the ATS parsing process.

2. **Standard Fonts**
   - Utilize standard system fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman to ensure compatibility across different systems.

3. **Clear Section Headings**
   - Use clear and distinct headings for each section (e.g., Experience, Education, Skills) to help ATS software identify and categorize information correctly.

4. **Consistent Use of Bullet Points**
   - Use bullet points for listing skills and achievements to enhance readability and parsing accuracy.
   - Limit the use of special characters and avoid emojis or icons.

5. **Avoidance of Headers and Footers**
   - Do not include information in headers or footers, as many ATS systems do not read these areas.

6. **File Format**
   - Export documents in formats that are widely accepted by ATS, such as PDF (with ATS-friendly settings) and DOCX.
   - Ensure that plain text exports are clean and free of any formatting that could confuse ATS systems.

7. **Content Optimization**
   - Focus on relevant keywords that match job descriptions to improve the chances of passing through ATS filters.
   - Use action verbs and quantifiable achievements to enhance the impact of the content.

8. **Testing for ATS Compatibility**
   - Regularly test exported documents with popular ATS systems to ensure compliance and identify any parsing issues.
   - Gather feedback from users regarding the visibility of their resumes in ATS.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these ATS compliance requirements, the exported documents will be optimized for better visibility and recognition by ATS software, ultimately aiding candidates in their job search efforts. Regular updates and testing should be conducted to keep up with evolving ATS technologies and standards.
